A Python package to compute and visualize observation metrics for periodic events. In Astronomy, *nighshift* is useful to answer the following questions:
- How much of an orbit with period $P$ has been observed given certain observation times? ([tutorial](ipynb/coverage))
- What period $P$ matches with this list of events? ([tutorial](ipynb/periodmatch))
- How a certain target must be observed to cover all orbits with periods lower than $P$ days?
